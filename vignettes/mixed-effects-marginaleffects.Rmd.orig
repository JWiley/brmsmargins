This vignette provides a brief overview of how to calculate 
marginal effects for Bayesian regression models involving 
only mixed effects (i.e., fixed and random) and fit using 
the `brms` package.

## Integrating out Random Effects


A random intercept logistic regression model where a binary (0/1) outcome, $Y$
is observed at the $i^{th}$ assessment for the $j^{th}$ person and there are 
$p$ variables included in the regression model can be written as:

$$
\hat{\pi}_{ij} = g \left(P \left( Y_{ij} = 1 \Big| X_{ij} = x_{ij}, u_j \right) \right) = \beta_0 + \sum_{k = 1}^p x_{ij,k} \beta_k + u_j 
$$

where $g(\cdot)$ indicates the link function, here the logit

$$
\mu = g(\pi) = ln\left(\frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}\right)
$$

and $g^{-1}(\cdot)$ is the inverse link function:

$$
\pi = g^{-1}(\mu) = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\mu)}
$$

A conditional predicted probability, conditional on the random effect can be calculated as:

$$
\hat{\pi}_{ij}(u_j = 0) = 
  P\left(Y_{ij} = 1 \Big| X_{ij} = x_{ij}, u_j = 0 \right) = 
  g^{-1} \left( \beta_0 + \sum_{k = 1}^p x_{ij,k} \beta_k + 0 \right)
$$


However, to correctly calculate a prediction that is marginal to the random 
effects, the random effects must be integrated out. Not set at a specific value 
or set at their mean (0).

$$
\hat{\pi}_{ij} = 
  P\left(Y_{ij} = 1 \Big| X_{ij} = x_{ij} \right) = 
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g^{-1} \left( \beta_0 + \sum_{k = 1}^p x_{ij,k} \beta_k + u \right)f(u)du
$$

Integrating out the random effects analytically can quickly become complex.
For example, it rapidly becomes more complex when there are multiple random effects,
such as if there is more than one grouping or clustering variable. It also 
can become more complex when different distributions are used / assumed.

Monte Carlo integration is a convenient, numerical approach that uses random 
samples to approximate the integral. Continuing the simple example of a 
logistic regression model where the only random effect is a random intercept,
$u_j$ and where we assume that $u_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2}_u)$,
we could draw $Q$ random samples, say 100, from $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2}_u)$, 
call these $RE_a$, then Monte Carlo integration would be:

$$
\hat{\pi}_{ij} = 
  P\left(Y_{ij} = 1 \Big| X_{ij} = x_{ij} \right) = 
  \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{a = 1}^{Q} g^{-1} \left( \beta_0 + \sum_{k = 1}^p x_{ij,k} \beta_k + RE_a \right)}{Q}
$$

This approach works for most generalized linear mixed models, although the outcome would 
not be a probability, necessarily, but whatever the result of the inverse 
link function is.

In a Bayesian framework, this approach would be repeated for each posterior draw as both 
the regression coefficients and $RE_a$ differs. Because this is repeated across each 
posterior draw, a very large number of random draws, $Q$, for the Monte Carlo integration
is probably not needed. Although a modest number, say $Q = 100$, would have a relatively 
large amount of simulation error, it is random error and when repeated across typically 
thousands of posterior draws, the impact is likely diminished.

Once we have these marginal predictions, we can calculate marginal effects
using numerical derivatives as:

$$
\frac{P\left(Y_{ij} = 1 \Big| X_{ij} = x_{ij} + h \right) - P\left(Y_{ij} = 1 \Big| X_{ij} = x_{ij} \right)}{h}
$$

which for a continuous variable provides an approximation of the derivative, 
often quite good as long as $h$ is sufficiently small.

## Using `brmsmargins()`

A simpler introduction and very brief overview and motivation
is available in the vignette for fixed effects only.
When there are fixed and random effects, calculating 
average marginal effects (AMEs) is more complicated. 
Generally, predictions are **conditional** on the random effects.
To deal with this, we need to integrate out the random effects 
for every prediction. Please note that this is quite computationally 
demanding, at least as currently implemented.
For every predicted value and each posterior draw, 
random samples from the model estimated random effects distribution are drawn, 
added, back transformed, and averaged.

Thus, if you wanted AMEs across a dataset of 1,000 people, 
with 2,000 posterior draws, and you wanted to use 100 points for the 
numerical integration, a total of 200 million (1,000 x 2,000 x 100) 
values are calculated. The monte carlo integration is implemented in C++
code to try to help speed up the process, but it is not "quick"
and also may be memory intensive.

Because of the complexity involved, only limited types of mixed effects
models are supported.


## Mixed Effects Logistic Regression

We will simulate some multilevel binary data for our 
mixed effects logistic regression model with individual differences
in both the intercept and slope.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
d <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 12345, code = {
    nGroups <- 100
    nObs <- 20
    theta.location <- matrix(rnorm(nGroups * 2), nrow = nGroups, ncol = 2)
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - mean(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] - mean(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] / sd(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] / sd(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location <- theta.location %*% chol(matrix(c(1.5, -.25, -.25, .5^2), 2))
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - 2.5
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] + 1
    d <- data.table(
      x = rep(rep(0:1, each = nObs / 2), times = nGroups))
    d[, ID := rep(seq_len(nGroups), each = nObs)]

    for (i in seq_len(nGroups)) {
      d[ID == i, y := rbinom(
        n = nObs,
        size = 1,
        prob = plogis(theta.location[i, 1] + theta.location[i, 2] * x))
        ]
    }
    copy(d)
  })

mlogit <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x | ID), family = "bernoulli",
  data = d, seed = 1234,
  silent = 2, refresh = 0,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr")
```


```{r}
summary(mlogit)
```

### AMEs

Now we can use `brmsmargins()`. By default, it will 
only use the fixed effects. To integrate out random effects,
we specify `effects = "integrateoutRE"`. The number of 
values used for numerical integration are set via the argument, `k`,
here `k = 100L`, the default. 
More details are in: `?brmsmargins:::.predict`

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame1 <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, h)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame1$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

We can follow a similar process getting discrete predictions at 
x held at 0 or 1. In this instance, the summary of 
predictions is more interesting as well, since they are at meaningfully
different values of `x`. They also agree quite closely with the 
average probability at different `x` values calculated in the data.

```{r}
ame2 <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  at = data.frame(x = c(0, 1)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)
```

Here is a summary of the predictions.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(ame2$Summary, digits = 3)
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(ame2$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(d[, .(M = mean(y)), by = .(ID, x)][, .(M = mean(M)), by = x])
```

Note that when integrating out random effects, the random seed is
quite important. If the `seed` argument is not specified,
`brmsmargins()` will randomly select one. This would not matter 
when generating predictions only from fixed effects, but when 
using random samples to integrate out random effects, if different 
random seeds are used for different predictions, you would expect
some (small) differences even for the same input data for prediction.
This may not be an issue for predictions on their own. However,
when numerically approximating a derivative by a very small difference 
in predictions, such as with `h = .001` tiny differences are magnified.
To see the impact, consider this example where we explicitly set multiple
random seeds, one for each row of the data used for predictions.
In both cases, we use exactly `x = 0`, so the difference is due to 
Monte Carlo variation only, but with `k = 10L` the small error, 
when divided by `h = .001` becomes very large, impossibly so.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame.error <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, 0)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 10L, seed = c(1234, 54321))

knitr::kable(ame.error$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

This disappears when we use the same seed for each row of the data 
used for predictions. Here we get all zeros for the difference, as 
we would expect. Note that you do not need to specify a seed for each
row of the data. You can specify one seed (or rely on `brmsmargins()` default),
which will then be used for all rows of the data.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame.noerror <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, 0)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 10L, seed = c(1234, 1234))

knitr::kable(ame.noerror$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

### Marginal Coefficients

The fixed effects coefficients are conditional on the random effects.
To aide interpretation, we also can calculate marginal coefficients or 
population averaged coefficients. The function to do this is 
`marginalcoef()` which uses the method described by Hedeker and colleagues
(2018). Here is an example and comparison to results using a single level 
logistic regression that ignores the clustering in the data.

```{r}
## calculate marginal coefficients
mc.logit <- marginalcoef(mlogit, CI = 0.95, seed = 1234)

## calculate single level logistic regression
glm.logit <- glm(y ~ 1 + x, family = "binomial", data = d)
glm.logit <- as.data.table(cbind(Est = coef(glm.logit), confint(glm.logit)))
```

Now we can view and compare the results.

```{r, results = 'asis'}

knitr::kable(cbind(
  mc.logit$Summary[, .(
    MargCoef = sprintf("%0.3f", round(M, 3)),
    MargCoefCI = sprintf("[%0.3f, %0.3f]", round(LL, 3), round(UL, 3)))],
  glm.logit[, .(
    GLMCoef = sprintf("%0.3f", round(Est, 3)),
    GLMCI = sprintf("[%0.3f, %0.3f]", round(`2.5 %`, 3), round(`97.5 %`, 3)))]))

```

## Mixed Effects Poisson Regression

We will simulate some multilevel poisson data for our 
mixed effects poisson regression model with individual differences
in both the intercept and slope.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
dpoisson <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 12345, code = {
    nGroups <- 100
    nObs <- 20
    theta.location <- matrix(rnorm(nGroups * 2), nrow = nGroups, ncol = 2)
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - mean(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] - mean(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] / sd(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] / sd(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location <- theta.location %*% chol(matrix(c(1.5, -.25, -.25, .5^2), 2))
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - 2.5
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] + 1
    d <- data.table(
      x = rep(rep(0:1, each = nObs / 2), times = nGroups))
    d[, ID := rep(seq_len(nGroups), each = nObs)]

    for (i in seq_len(nGroups)) {
      d[ID == i, y := rpois(
        n = nObs,
        lambda = exp(theta.location[i, 1] + theta.location[i, 2] * x))
        ]
    }
    copy(d)
  })

mpois <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x | ID), family = "poisson",
  data = dpoisson, seed = 1234,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr",
  silent = 2, refresh = 0, adapt_delta = 0.99)
```

```{r}
summary(mpois)
```

### AMEs

We use `brmsmargins()` in the same way as for the mixed effects logistic regression.
Here is an example with a numeric derivative treating `x` as continuous.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame1.pois <- brmsmargins(
  mpois,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, h)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame1.pois$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

Here is an example treating `x` as discrete.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
ame2.pois <- brmsmargins(
  mpois,
  at = data.frame(x = c(0, 1)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame2.pois$ContrastSummary)
```

### Marginal Coefficients

Just as for mixed effects logistic regression, 
we can calculate marginal or population averaged coefficients for 
mixed effects poisson regression using the same process as described 
by Hedeker and colleagues (2018).
Here is an example and comparison to results using a single level 
poisson regression that ignores the clustering in the data.

```{r}
## calculate marginal coefficients
mc.pois <- marginalcoef(mpois, CI = 0.95, seed = 1234)

## calculate single level logistic regression
glm.pois <- glm(y ~ 1 + x, family = "poisson", data = d)
glm.pois <- as.data.table(cbind(Est = coef(glm.pois), confint(glm.pois)))
```

Now we can view and compare the results.

```{r, results = 'asis'}

knitr::kable(cbind(
  mc.pois$Summary[, .(
    MargCoef = sprintf("%0.3f", round(M, 3)),
    MargCoefCI = sprintf("[%0.3f, %0.3f]", round(LL, 3), round(UL, 3)))],
  glm.pois[, .(
    GLMCoef = sprintf("%0.3f", round(Est, 3)),
    GLMCI = sprintf("[%0.3f, %0.3f]", round(`2.5 %`, 3), round(`97.5 %`, 3)))]))

```

## Mixed Effects Negative Binomial Regression

Negative binomial models work the same way as for poisson models.
We use the same dataset, just for demonstration.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
mnb <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x | ID), family = "negbinomial",
  data = dpoisson, seed = 1234,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr",
  silent = 2, refresh = 0, adapt_delta = 0.99)
```

```{r}
summary(mnb)
```

### AMEs

We use `brmsmargins()` in the same way as for the mixed effects poisson regression.
Here is an example with a numeric derivative treating `x` as continuous.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame1.nb <- brmsmargins(
  mnb,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, h)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame1.nb$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

Here is an example treating `x` as discrete.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
ame2.nb <- brmsmargins(
  mnb,
  at = data.frame(x = c(0, 1)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame2.nb$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

### Marginal Coefficients

Negative binomial models cannot be fit by the `glm()` function in `R`
so we just show the population averaged values from `brms`.

```{r}
## calculate marginal coefficients
mc.nb <- marginalcoef(mnb, CI = 0.95, seed = 1234)
```

View the results.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(
  mc.nb$Summary[, .(
    MargCoef = sprintf("%0.3f", round(M, 3)),
    MargCoefCI = sprintf("[%0.3f, %0.3f]", round(LL, 3), round(UL, 3)))])
```

## Centered Categorical Predictors

In mixed effects models, it is common to center continuous predictors.
Consider a longitudinal study where sleep was collected nightly for a week
in multiple people. Hours of sleep duration will have variation that 
exists between people (different people have different typical or average 
sleep durations) and within people (the same person will sleep different 
amounts on different nights).

Entering observed hours of sleep duration as a predictor in the model will 
conflate associations between sleep duration and the outcome that exist 
at the between person and within person level.

Here is a small example for two people with observed sleep ("Sleep"), the between
person component, the average sleep per person ("BSleep"), and 
the within person sleep, the person centered sleep duration ("WSleep").

| ID | Sleep | BSleep | WSleep |
|:--:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
| 1  | 6     | 7      | -1     |
| 1  | 7     | 7      | 0      |
| 1  | 8     | 7      | +1     |
| 2  | 4     | 5      | -1     |
| 2  | 5     | 5      | 0      |
| 2  | 6     | 5      | +1     |

These values are obtained by averaging the observed sleep values by ID.
Then by taking the difference between the observed sleep duration values 
and the between person mean sleep values, thus:

$$
WSleep = Sleep - BSleep
$$

Both `BSleep` and `WSleep` could be included as predictor variables in a model,
or if the interest is solely in the within person association, `WSleep` only
included.

This type of centering is relatively common in mixed effects or multilevel models,
at least for continuous predictors. The presence, or absence, of such centering
for continuous variables has relatively little bearing on calculating the 
average marginal effects (AMEs) as generally both variables remain continuous 
and a derivative makes sense.

In contrast to continuous predictors where it is common, it is relatively 
*un*common to center categorical predictors. However, research 
(Yaremych, Preacher, & Hedeker, 2021) highlights how the same rationale 
that apply to continuous predictors, in regards to the benefits of centering,
equally apply to categorical predictors. 
One area where particular attention has been paid to the importance 
of centering, whether continuous or categorical predictors,
are in individual participant data meta analyses (IPDMA) with one stage analyses.
In these IPDMA where there are treatment x covariate interactions to evaluate 
effect modifiers, centering the predictor / covariate is critical for 
avoiding 'ecological bias' (Hua et al., 2017).

Yaremych et al (2021) showed that an equivalent algebraic approach to 
creating centered continuous variables can be applied to categorical variables, 
after coding (e.g., using dummy coding). In the same study used for the 
continuous example, suppose that whether or not people had a good night's
sleep was recorded dummy coded as yes = 1 and no = 0. 
This table shows how it might be centered.

| ID | GoodSleep | BSleep | WSleep |
|:--:|:---------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1  | 0         | 0.50   | -0.50  |
| 1  | 0         | 0.50   | -0.50  |
| 1  | 1         | 0.50   | +0.50  |
| 1  | 1         | 0.50   | +0.50  |
| 2  | 0         | 0.75   | -0.75  |
| 2  | 1         | 0.75   | +0.25  |
| 2  | 1         | 0.75   | +0.25  |
| 2  | 1         | 0.75   | +0.25  |
| 3  | 0         | 0      | 0      |
| 3  | 0         | 0      | 0      |
| 3  | 0         | 0      | 0      |
| 3  | 0         | 0      | 0      |

We can include these new variables as predictors in a model just as any other 
predictors. However, in contrast to the continuous case where for the AMEs we 
tend to calculate a derivative, the categorical case is more challenging.
Typically, for categorical variables, AMEs are calculated as the 
AME moving from one category to another category.
This can easily be accomplished in `brmsmargins` using the `at` argument.
However, when a categorical variable is centered by ID, the values
for one category are not constant by ID.

To address, this, `brmsmargins` implements an additional argument, `wat` 
for within level `at`. This argument is used to give the values to be used 
at each ID level. The `wat` argument is used in conjuction with the `at` argument.
The `at` argument continues to be used for the general setup, with `wat` used 
for the specific values.

This is more easily shown than said. Here we simulate some multilevel data
with a binary predictor, `x` and a binary outcome, `y`.

```{r}
d <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 12345, code = {
    nGroups <- 100
    nObs <- 20
    theta.location <- matrix(rnorm(nGroups * 2), nrow = nGroups, ncol = 2)
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - mean(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] - mean(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] / sd(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] / sd(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location <- theta.location %*% chol(matrix(c(1.5, -.25, -.25, .5^2), 2))
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - 2.5
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] + 1

    d <- data.table(ID = seq_len(nGroups))
    d <- d[, .(x = rbinom(n = nObs, size = 1, prob = runif(1, 0, 1))), by = ID]

    for (i in seq_len(nGroups)) {
      d[ID == i, y := rbinom(
        n = nObs,
        size = 1,
        prob = plogis(theta.location[i, 1] + theta.location[i, 2] * x))
        ]
    }
    copy(d)
  })
```

Now we can create a between and within person version of `x`,
which we will call `xb` and `xw`. We also fit the `brms` model, using
`xw`. In this instance we are not interested in any between person effects,
so that variable is omitted. Any variation not explained by it will go into 
the random intercept, anyways.

```{r, results = "hide"}
## within person centering binary predictor
d[, xb := mean(x), by = ID]
d[, xw := x - xb]

mlogitcent <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + xw + (1 + xw | ID), family = "bernoulli",
  data = d, seed = 1234,
  silent = 2, refresh = 0,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr")
``` 

Now comes the new part. Based on how we coded our predictor, `x`,
we will create the two values by ID. In this case, `x` was coded 
as 0 and 1. So we start with 0 as the low value and 1 as the high value.
Then we need to take the difference between 0 and 1 with the mean 
by ID. We (arbitrarily) label these `a` and `b`.
We could have chosen any label, `min` and `max` or `low` and `high` or
whatever we wanted. It just needs to be distinct and something that 
`brmsmargins()` can match between the `at` and the `wat` arguments.
The resulting data get turned into a single long `data.table`,
called `xwid`. We use this to create a list, saved as `usewat`.
The list must have two elements at a minimum:

1. A named element, named "ID" that contains a character string with
   the name of the ID variable.
2. An element named after the centered variable, with a `data.frame` 
   or `data.table` containing the values to use for each ID and
   for each label we chose, here `a` and `b`.
   
The table shows a few examples of what the dataset looks like.

```{r, results = "asis"}

xwid <- melt(
  d[, .(a = 0 - na.omit(xb)[1],
        b = 1 - na.omit(xb)[1]),
    by = ID], id.vars = "ID")

usewat <- list(ID = "ID", xw = xwid)

knitr::kable(xwid[ID %in% c(1, 2, 4, 100)][order(ID)], digits = 2)
```

This new dataset shows what values to use for moving from
one category of `x` to another category of `x` looks like, 
for each ID. Note that sometimes these are the same. In the case 
of ID 1, all `x` values were identical and thus all `xw` values
will be 0. This is appropriate because for that ID, there was no 
variation on `x` and so we have no idea what the "true" change 
for ID 1 would be if moving from one category to another.

Now we can use `brmsmargins()` to calculate the AME.
We must still specify the `at` argument. Here we use
our arbitrary lables of `a` and `b` for the variable,
`xw`. We also pass our list to the argument `wat`.
Internally, `brmsmargins()` will substitute `a` for
all the values for `a` by ID from our list, and similarly for 
`b`. The reason for this separation is in the `at` argument,
one might have specific values of other variables as well,
had there been other predictors in the model.

The resulting summary gives the average marginal predictions 
for `xw = a` and `xw = b` which in our case refers to when 
`xw` is at 0 on `x` **for that ID** and when it is at 1 for `x`
**for that ID**.

```{r, results = "asis"}
ame.cent <- brmsmargins(
  object = mlogitcent,
  at = expand.grid(xw = c("a", "b")),
  wat = usewat,
  contrasts = cbind("AME xw" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 20L)

knitr::kable(ame.cent$Summary, digits = 3)
```

Just as in other examples, we can get a summary of the
contrast of these two values, our AME.

```{r, results = "asis"}
knitr::kable(ame.cent$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

## Interactions and Marginal Effects

As a final example, we will look at a model with an interaction.
Specifically we have a binary outcome, `y`, measured repeatedly.
A binary predictor, `x` measured repeatedly within units and 
group membership, `Group`, a binary variable that is constant within 
units so only varies between units.

To map these to a concrete potential research question, suppose that 
100 people were randomized 1:1 to either a waitlist control group 
(Group = 0) or an emotion regulation intervention designed to help 
manage stress (Group = 1). After completing the intervention, 
participants completed 20 days of daily diaries. Sleep was recorded 
each day and categorized as a good night sleep 
(`y` = 1) or a poor night sleep (`y` = 0).
Each day participants' also reported whether they experienced 
no stressor (`x` = 0) or any stressor (`x` = 1).

The goal is to examine whether the intervention group moderates 
participants' stress reactivity, defined as the association between 
experiencing a stressor or not on a given day and whether they have 
good or poor sleep that night. Based on clinical judgement and the 
intervention cost, it is estimated that any probability difference 
of plus or minus 2% is practically equivalent, so the 
region of practical equivalence (ROPE) is set at -0.02 to +0.02.
A probability difference of 5% or more is considered the minimally 
important difference (MID), the smallest difference that is clinically 
meaningful. Thus the MID is set at less than or equal to -0.05 or 
greater than or equal to +0.05.

To show this example, we first simulate a dataset, using a similar 
process as in previous examples.

```{r}
d <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 12345, code = {
    nGroups <- 100
    nObs <- 20
    theta.location <- matrix(rnorm(nGroups * 2), nrow = nGroups, ncol = 2)
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - mean(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] - mean(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] / sd(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] / sd(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location <- theta.location %*% chol(matrix(c(1.5, -.25, -.25, .5^2), 2))
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - 2.5
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] + rep(c(-1, 1), each = nGroups / 2)

    d <- data.table(ID = seq_len(nGroups), group = rep(0:1, each = nGroups / 2))
    d <- d[, .(x = rbinom(n = nObs, size = 1, prob = runif(1, 0, 1))), by = .(ID, group)]

    for (i in seq_len(nGroups)) {
      d[ID == i, y := rbinom(
        n = nObs,
        size = 1,
        prob = plogis(theta.location[i, 1] + theta.location[i, 2] * x))
        ]
    }
    copy(d)
  })
```

Following the earlier example, we center our binary predictor, `x`
(whether participants experienced any stressor that day).
This separates the effects of experiencing a stressor within a person 
from the fact that some people may experience stressors most days 
or rarely experience any stressors. We call the between person variable,
the average proportion of days experiencing a stressor, `xb`.
We call the within person variable, `xw`. As in the example on 
centering within person categorical variables, we also create a 
dataset with the within person hypothetical values for each person,
`usewat`.

```{r}
## within person centering binary predictor
d[, xb := mean(x), by = ID]
d[, xw := x - xb]

xwid <- melt(
  d[, .(a = 0 - na.omit(xb)[1],
        b = 1 - na.omit(xb)[1]),
    by = ID], id.vars = "ID")

usewat <- list(ID = "ID", xw = xwid)
```

Group is measured between people so we do not need to center it.
We include a random slope by `xw` (within person experience or not of a stressor)
and an interaction between `xw` and `Group` to evaluate whether the 
association between experiencing a stressor on a given day, at the within person level,
is associated with a good or poor night sleep and whether that differs 
between people randomized to the waitlist control or the intervention.
The model can be fit as in the following code.

```{r, results = "hide"}
mlogitcentint <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + xw * group + xb + (1 + xw | ID), family = "bernoulli",
  data = d, seed = 1234,
  silent = 2, refresh = 0,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr")
``` 

We will generate average marginal predicted probabilities 
for each group and with within person stressor exposure held at
none and any. The grid of possibilities is created and stored in 
`use.at` and shown in the following table.

```{r, results = "asis"}
use.at <- expand.grid(group = 0:1, xw = c("a", "b"))
knitr::kable(use.at, digits = 0)
```

From this grid, there are three contrasts of interest.

1. What is the average marginal effect (AME) of 
within person stressor exposure on good or poor sleep 
that night if everyone were randomized to the waitlist control group?
2. What is the AME of within person stressor exposure on good or poor sleep
that night if everyone were randomized to the intervention group?
3. What is the difference in the AME of within person stressor exposure
between the intervention and waitlist control group?

A quick way to create this contrast matrix is to start 
with our contrast codes for the AME: -1 and +1. 
We use the kronecker product with a 2 x 2 identity matrix
to expand this into the contrast codes needed for our 
1st and 2nd questions. Then we take the difference in contrast
weights between these two which are the weights for the 3rd question.
The code to do this and the resulting contrast matrix with labels 
is shown in the following code and table.

```{r, results = "asis"}
contr.mat <- cbind(xw = c(-1, 1)) %x% diag(2)
contr.mat <- cbind(
  contr.mat,
  contr.mat[, 2] - contr.mat[, 1])

colnames(contr.mat) <- c(
  paste0("AME xw: Grp ", 0:1),
  "delta AME xw")

knitr::kable(contr.mat, digits = 0)
```

Now we can use `brmsmargins()` with the model, 
our grid of values to generate average marginal predictions,
and our contrast matrix to generate the AMEs and answer our 
three questions. We specify here that we want 95% credible intervals,
and we specify the desired ROPE and MID regions as well as the 
seed so that we can reproduce the results exactly.
Once run, we can see the average marginal predictions for our grid 
of values in `use.at` in the following table.

```{r, results = "asis"}
ame.centint <- brmsmargins(
  object = mlogitcentint,
  at = use.at,
  wat = usewat,
  contrasts = contr.mat, CI = 0.95,
  ROPE = c(-.02, .02), MID = c(-.05, .05),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 20L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame.centint$Summary[, .(M, LL, UL, CI, CIType)], digits = 3)
```

Finally we can look at the contrast summary to answer our three 
questions of interest: the two simple AMEs of within person stressor 
exposure and the difference between intervention conditions in those AMEs.
These are shown in the following table.

From the results, we can see that if everyone were randomized 
to the waitlist control group, we would expect a lower probability
of a good night sleep on stressor compared to non stressor days,
at the within person level. This effect is unlikely to be 
practically equivalent to 0 (< 5% of the posterior falls in the ROPE) 
but it also is not clearly exceeding the MID with < 90% of the posterior 
distribution exceeding the MID.

In comparison, if everyone were randomized to the intervention group,
we would expect a better night sleep on stressor compared to non stressor 
days at the within person level. This is unlikely to be an effect 
practically equivalent to zero (< 5% of the posterior falls in the ROPE)
and is likely to be at least a MID, as most of the posterior exceeds 
the MID.

Finally, we can see that the difference in the AMEs between 
the control and intervention groups is quite large, with none of the 
posterior distribution falling in the ROPE and nearly all of it exceeding 
the MID.

We can also see that our contrast coding did indeed yield the difference between 
the two simple AMEs and can confirm with 'by hand' calculations that the 
mean contrast estimate for the group difference is indeed the mean 
for the AME for the intervention (Grp 1) minus the mean for the AME 
for the waitlist control (Grp 0). Collectively, this suggests that 
within people, days they are exposed to a stressor or not is associated 
with their sleep that night, and that the emotion regulation intervention 
moderates the association between within person stressor exposure and sleep.

```{r, results = "asis"}
knitr::kable(ame.centint$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```
