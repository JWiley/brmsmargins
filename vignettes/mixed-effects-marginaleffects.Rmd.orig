This vignette provides a brief overview of how to calculate 
marginal effects for Bayesian regression models involving 
only mixed effects (i.e., fixed and random) and fit using 
the `brms` package.

A simpler introduction and very brief overview and motivation
is available in the vignette for fixed effects only.
When there are fixed and random effects, calculating 
average marginal effects (AMEs) is more complicated. 
Generally, predictions are **conditional** on the random effects.
To deal with this, we need to integrate out the random effects 
for every prediction. Please note that this is quite computationally 
demanding, at least as currently implemented.
For every predicted value and each posterior draw, 
random samples from the model estimated random effects distribution are drawn, 
added, back transformed, and averaged.

Thus, if you wanted AMEs across a dataset of 1,000 people, 
with 2,000 posterior draws, and you wanted to use 100 points for the 
numerical integration, a total of 200 million (1,000 x 2,000 x 100) 
values are calculated. The monte carlo integration is implemented in C++
code to try to help speed up the process, but it is not "quick"
and also may be memory intensive.

Because of the complexity involved, only limited types of mixed effects
models are supported.


## AMEs for Mixed Effects Logistic Regression

We will simulate some multilevel binary data for our 
mixed effects logistic regression model with individual differences
in both the intercept and slope.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
d <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 12345, code = {
    nGroups <- 100
    nObs <- 20
    theta.location <- matrix(rnorm(nGroups * 2), nrow = nGroups, ncol = 2)
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - mean(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] - mean(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] / sd(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] / sd(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location <- theta.location %*% chol(matrix(c(1.5, -.25, -.25, .5^2), 2))
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - 2.5
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] + 1
    d <- data.table(
      x = rep(rep(0:1, each = nObs / 2), times = nGroups))
    d[, ID := rep(seq_len(nGroups), each = nObs)]

    for (i in seq_len(nGroups)) {
      d[ID == i, y := rbinom(
        n = nObs,
        size = 1,
        prob = plogis(theta.location[i, 1] + theta.location[i, 2] * x))
        ]
    }
    copy(d)
  })

mlogit <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x | ID), family = "bernoulli",
  data = d, seed = 1234,
  silent = 2, refresh = 0,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr")
```


```{r}
summary(mlogit)
```


Now we can use `brmsmargins()`. By default, it will 
only use the fixed effects. To integrate out random effects,
we specify `effects = "integrateoutRE"`. The number of 
values used for numerical integration are set via the argument, `k`,
here `k = 100L`, the default. 
More details are in: `?brmsmargins:::.predict`

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame1 <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, h)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame1$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

We can follow a similar process getting discrete predictions at 
x held at 0 or 1. In this instance, the summary of 
predictions is more interesting as well, since they are at meaningfully
different values of `x`. They also agree quite closely with the 
average probability at different `x` values calculated in the data.

```{r}
ame2 <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  at = data.frame(x = c(0, 1)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)
```

Here is a summary of the predictions.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(ame2$Summary, digits = 3)
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(ame2$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(d[, .(M = mean(y)), by = .(ID, x)][, .(M = mean(M)), by = x])
```

Note that when integrating out random effects, the random seed is
quite important. If the `seed` argument is not specified,
`brmsmargins()` will randomly select one. This would not matter 
when generating predictions only from fixed effects, but when 
using random samples to integrate out random effects, if different 
random seeds are used for different predictions, you would expect
some (small) differences even for the same input data for prediction.
This may not be an issue for predictions on their own. However,
when numerically approximating a derivative by a very small difference 
in predictions, such as with `h = .001` tiny differences are magnified.
To see the impact, consider this example where we explicitly set multiple
random seeds, one for each row of the data used for predictions.
In both cases, we use exactly `x = 0`, so the difference is due to 
Monte Carlo variation only, but with `k = 10L` the small error, 
when divided by `h = .001` becomes very large, impossibly so.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame.error <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, 0)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 10L, seed = c(1234, 54321))

knitr::kable(ame.error$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

This disappears when we use the same seed for each row of the data 
used for predictions. Here we get all zeros for the difference, as 
we would expect. Note that you do not need to specify a seed for each
row of the data. You can specify one seed (or rely on `brmsmargins()` default),
which will then be used for all rows of the data.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame.noerror <- brmsmargins(
  mlogit,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, 0)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 10L, seed = c(1234, 1234))

knitr::kable(ame.noerror$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

## AMEs for Mixed Effects Poisson Regression

We will simulate some multilevel poisson data for our 
mixed effects poisson regression model with individual differences
in both the intercept and slope.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
dpoisson <- withr::with_seed(
  seed = 12345, code = {
    nGroups <- 100
    nObs <- 20
    theta.location <- matrix(rnorm(nGroups * 2), nrow = nGroups, ncol = 2)
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - mean(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] - mean(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] / sd(theta.location[, 1])
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] / sd(theta.location[, 2])
    theta.location <- theta.location %*% chol(matrix(c(1.5, -.25, -.25, .5^2), 2))
    theta.location[, 1] <- theta.location[, 1] - 2.5
    theta.location[, 2] <- theta.location[, 2] + 1
    d <- data.table(
      x = rep(rep(0:1, each = nObs / 2), times = nGroups))
    d[, ID := rep(seq_len(nGroups), each = nObs)]

    for (i in seq_len(nGroups)) {
      d[ID == i, y := rpois(
        n = nObs,
        lambda = exp(theta.location[i, 1] + theta.location[i, 2] * x))
        ]
    }
    copy(d)
  })

mpois <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x | ID), family = "poisson",
  data = dpoisson, seed = 1234,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr",
  silent = 2, refresh = 0)
```

```{r}
summary(mpois)
```

We use `brmsmargins()` in the same way as for the mixed effects logistic regression.
Here is an example with a numeric derivative treating `x` as continuous.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame1.pois <- brmsmargins(
  mpois,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, h)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame1.pois$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

Here is an example treating `x` as discrete.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
ame2.pois <- brmsmargins(
  mpois,
  at = data.frame(x = c(0, 1)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame2.pois$ContrastSummary)
```


## AMEs for Mixed Effects Negative Binomial Regression

Negative binomial models work the same way as for poisson models.
We use the same dataset, just for demonstration.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
mnb <- brms::brm(
  y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x | ID), family = "negbinomial",
  data = dpoisson, seed = 1234,
  chains = 4L, cores = 4L, backend = "cmdstanr",
  silent = 2, refresh = 0)
```

```{r}
summary(mnb)
```

We use `brmsmargins()` in the same way as for the mixed effects poisson regression.
Here is an example with a numeric derivative treating `x` as continuous.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
h <- .001
ame1.nb <- brmsmargins(
  mnb,
  add = data.frame(x = c(0, h)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1 / h, 1 / h)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame1.nb$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```

Here is an example treating `x` as discrete.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
ame2.nb <- brmsmargins(
  mnb,
  at = data.frame(x = c(0, 1)),
  contrasts = cbind("AME x" = c(-1, 1)),
  effects = "integrateoutRE", k = 100L, seed = 1234)

knitr::kable(ame2.nb$ContrastSummary, digits = 3)
```
