\title{Personal Preference Based Bayesian Summary}
\usage{
bsummary(x, CI = 0.99, CIType = "HDI", ROPE = NULL, MID = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The posterior distribution of a parameter}

\item{CI}{A numeric value indicating the desired width of the credible interval.
Defaults to \code{0.99} currently, but this is subject to change.
a 99\% interval was chosen as the default as there have been recent arguments
made in the realm of meta science that there are, essentially, too many
false positives and that many of the \dQuote{findings} in science are not able
to be replicated.
In any case, users should ideally specify a desired CI width, and not rely on
defaults.}

\item{CIType}{A character string indicating the type of credible interval, passed on
to the \code{\link[bayestestR]{ci}} function as the method for CIs.}

\item{ROPE}{Either left as \code{NULL}, the default, or a numeric vector of
length 2, specifying the lower and upper thresholds for the
Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE).}

\item{MID}{Either left as \code{NULL}, the default, or a numeric vector of
length 2, specifying the lower and upper thresholds for a
Minimally Important Difference (MID). Unlike the ROPE, percentages for
the MID are calculated as at or exceeding the bounds specified by this
argument, whereas the ROPE is the percentage of the posterior at or inside
the bounds specified.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the mean, \code{M}
\describe{
\item{M}{the mean of the posterior samples}
\item{Mdn}{the median of the posterior samples}
\item{LL}{the lower limit of the credible interval}
\item{UL}{the upper limit of the credible interval}
\item{PercentROPE}{the percentage of posterior samples falling into the ROPE}
\item{PercentMID}{the percentage of posterior samples falling at or beyond the MID}
\item{CI}{the width of the credible interval used}
\item{CIType}{the type of credible interval used (e.g., highest density interval)}
\item{ROPE}{a label describing the values included in the ROPE}
\item{MID}{a label describing the values included in the MID}
}
}
\description{
Returns a summary of a posterior distribution for a single
parameter / value. It is based on personal preference. Notably, it does not
only use \code{bayestestR::describe_posterior}, an excellent function,
because of the desire to also describe the percentage of the full posterior
distribution that is at or exceeding the value of a
Minimally Important Difference (MID). MIDs are used in clinical studies with outcome
measures where there are pre-defined differences that are considered clinically
important, which is distinct from the ROPE or general credible intervals capturing
uncertainty.
