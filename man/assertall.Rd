\title{Internal functions to check assertions about a \code{brmsfit} model object}
\usage{
.assertbrmsfit(object)

.assertgaussian(object)

.assertfamily(object)

.assertlink(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{brmsfit} model object to be evaluated.}
}
\value{
An invisible, logical \code{TRUE} if the assertion is met.
An (informative) error message if the assertion is not met.
}
\description{
These are a set of internal utility functions.
They are not intended for general use.
Instead, they are intended to be called in circumstances
where the expected result is \code{TRUE}.
All of them are designed to try to give informative error
messages if the assertion is not met.
All of them result in a \code{stop()} error if the assertion is not met.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item{\code{.assertbrmsfit}}{asserts that the object should be of class \code{brmsfit}.}
\item{\code{.assertgaussian}}{asserts that all random effects are Gaussian.}
\item{\code{.assertfamily}}{asserts that the distribution (family) of the outcome is a currently supported family. Only applies when integrating out random effects.}
\item{\code{.assertlink}}{asserts that the link function is a currently supported link function. Only applies when integrating out random effects.}
